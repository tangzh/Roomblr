## What do
Roomblr allows tumblr users to join a group that populates a post feed by aggregating tags from everyone's liked posts. A user just needs to log in, and immediately they will start seeing posts based on tags from posts they've liked, but also posts people in the group have liked. The group is maintained in Parse. Users may also follow other tumblr users, like posts, reblog posts, or create a new post and share it with the room. Newer versions may also allow black/whitelisting tags from the group feed.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see the text posts that share the same tags with the posts that I've liked so that it's more likely to show me something that I'm interested in.
- As a user, I want to see the text posts that other people have liked in the same room so that I can see what are the things that they are interested in and what is trending.
- As a user, I want to be able to login into this app through Tumblr OAuth so that I don't need to create another account.
- As a user, I want this app to have simple and modern UI like twitter and instagram.
- As a user, I want to be able to perform basic social interactions including creating new post, liking a post and reblogging a post.
- As a user, I want to see both a dashboard listing all the posts and a detail view of a specific post, so that I can dive into one post that I'm particularly interested in.
- As a user, I want to see the status of a post including liked/reblogged status.

#### Bonus

- As a user, I want the app to support other types of posts other than text posts.
- As a user, I want to be able to whitelist/blacklist tags so that I can avoid seeing posts I don't like on my dashboard.
